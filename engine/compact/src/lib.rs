//! This crate makes it possible to store objects containing dynamic fields
//! either compactly in consecutive memory or using traditional heap pointers.
//!
//! Bread-and-butter datastructures are offered, they feature:
//!
//!   * transparent access semantics, independent of currently used storage
//!   * automatic spill from exhausted compact storage to heap storage
//!   * recursive re-compaction
//!
//! This is used in `Kay` for:
//!
//!   * Storing actor state compactly in one place for cache coherency and easy persistence
//!   * Sending complex, dynamically-sized messages over boundaries
//!     such as actors, threads and the network
